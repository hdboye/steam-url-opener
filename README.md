# steam-url-opener

Chromium extension that opens URLs in the Steam Client.

Currently supports any chromium-based browser. FYI you can always inspect source code and build yourself if you don't trust my pre-built crx.

Make an issue if you have a feature request, or code it in yourself and make a PR! If it's good i'll almost always accept it.

## Installation
Go to the extensions menu on your chromium browser, enable Developer Mode then drag [the CRX file from Releases](https://github.com/hdboye/steam-url-opener/releases/latest) into the page. Now restart the browser (or don't) and enjoy!

## Build it yourself
[Download the source](https://github.com/hdboye/steam-url-opener/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) from this github, or if you want a specific version go [here](https://github.com/hdboye/steam-url-opener/releases) and download the source code for whatever version you want. Unzip it then go to the extension menu on your chromium browser. Enable Developer Mode then press Pack Extension and select the folder where the source is.

You can also load the source instead of packing it into crx by just pressing Load Unzipped Extension (idk what it is in english).


There's also [a webpage version of this README](https://hdboye.github.io/steam-url-opener) but i don't know why you'd wanna use it.
