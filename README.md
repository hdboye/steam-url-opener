# steam-url-opener

Chrome Extension to open Steam URLs in the Steam Client.

If you don't trust it (it DOES say that i can see your browser history..) then just check the code out yourself and use the source code instead of my pre-built crx. Trust me, i won't track you with this.

## Installation
Go to the extensions menu on your chromium browser, enable Developer Mode then drag the CRX file from Releases into the page. Now restart the browser (or don't) and enjoy!

## Build it yourself
Download the source from this github, unzip it then go to the extensiosn menu on your chromium browser. Enable Developer Mode then press Pack Extension and select the folder where the source is.

You can also load the source instead of packing it into crx by just pressing Load Unzipped Extension (idk what it is in english).
